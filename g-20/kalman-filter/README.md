# kalman-filter

Simple Kalman filter implementation and post-processing of measurement values. The program also implements Cortex Microprocessor Software interface Standard (CMSIS) application programming interface that incorporates a large set of routines optimized for different ARM Cortex processors.

Kalman filter is a state-based adaptive estimator of a physical process that is known to be optimal with respect to the estimation error when the noise is Gaussian and the system is linear. It is the type of an adaptive filter which is generally preferred to the fixed linear filters. The state space adaptation is performed by a sequence of discrete steps, where the parameters of the filter change based on the observed physical values and on the current state.
