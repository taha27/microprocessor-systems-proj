#peripherals-interrupts-and-timers
This program is an introductory exercise for configuring the peripherals attached to the processor in the F4-Discovery kit. It is aimed at designing a system that detects the board's tilt agnles by processing readings of a tri-axial accelerometer. The ST accelerometer sensor LIS3DSH (the MB997C version) is used to sample the accelerometer at a rate of 25 Hz. The MEMS sensor generates an interrupt once data is ready via an associated GPIO. 

This core embedded design serves a higher-level application. The board is put into a certain initial orientation and the user enter a desidred board tilt angle using a 3x4 alphanumeric keypad. The board is also interfaced with a 4-digit 7-segment display. Given the initial orientation of the board and the desired input orientation, the display will visualize the direction the board is moved from its current position to meet the target orientation. Once the board is within 5ÌŠ of the target orientatio, the user input angle is shown on the segment display. The on-board LEDs are also incorporated in the animation procedure to signal tilt directions and proximity to desired angle.
