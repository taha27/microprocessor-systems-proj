#rtos-integration
This lab is aimed at designing a multithreaded system that uses CMSIS-RTOS (RTX based) for initiating and maintaining multiple threads of computation and handling the exception types concurrently. The temperature and accelerometer sensors are used to perform a seamless superset of sensing and displaying functions. A 7-Segment clock display interchangeably displays the processed outputs of the thermometer and the accelerometers, where the two modes are switched by pressing a keypad button. A fully-integrated system is designed where all functions are seamlessly integrated in multiple threads of computation and Interrupt Service Routines (ISRs).
